My Data Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning work

The Python file show cases what each graph represents, as well as how it can be used to make business decisions.
It visualizes data in a variety of forms, showing customer spending, and variables that correlate to their spending.
It demonstrates linear regression lines
And later, Machine Learning is performed, and its predictions are compared to the actual results of test daa.

The Linear Regression model, using Machine Learning, is actually quite a good fit for the data.
